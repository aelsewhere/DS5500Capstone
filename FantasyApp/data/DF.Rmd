This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(nflfastR)
library(dplyr)

seasons <- c(2020)

# Initialize an empty list to store the dataframes

# Load data for each season and store it in the list
for (season in seasons) {
  nfl_data <- load_pbp(season = season)
  all_nfl_data[[as.character(season)]] <- nfl_data
}
